Semantic eCommerce Search: 

HycubeSearch+ would automatically understand a query such as “Blue Shirt under $150”, even if Blue is not mentioned in the title or short description. It understands that the key word is Shirt, that the attribute is Blue, and that the price range is up to $150. 

Rich AutoComplete: 

From the first character they type, shoppers see lightning-fast product suggestions. You engage customers instantly, and can get up to 20-30% of searches reach a result without ever ending the typing or getting to a search results page. Even if customers misspell, HycubeSearch+ will correct it in the dropdown on the fly.

Responsive Search Results Page (SERP) 

HycubeSearch+ premium search results page works for mobile, tablet, and desktop. Search filters are auto-generated and optimized for customers’ queries.

It's contemporary design automatically adapts to your store's CSS. Because it is hosted, it's fast and does not load your Magento server. 

Indivudalized Search Results
